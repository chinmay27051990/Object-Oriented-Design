Created a Source Code Publisher in C++,.Net & WPF GUI which interacts with the native code using a C++/CLI wrapper and converts a source code into a web page by publishing all the files that match a regular expression.In this way, native code applications get support of GUI.
The project retrieves files chosen by client by maneuvering through a directory tree.The publisher converts the source code files into .html files by parsing them.It wraps the content of the code in div blocks and links all the dependent files to them.File upload and deletion is supported by the remote code manager using a message passing asynchronous communication channel.
